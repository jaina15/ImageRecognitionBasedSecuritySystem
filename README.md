# ImageRecognitionBasedSecuritySystem
This is an image recognition based security system that allows only the family members to access the Locker/Safe, etc. It can be used for many security system.
It is based on OpenCV library.
It is my first project in python and it is in process.
Their are many applications of this project, i.e it can be used in colleges to automatically mark the attendence of the student like the one currently being used in DTU, it can be used in hospitals to recognize the face of the patient and tell what previous medication he had taken and tell all details about her. We can do a lot more.
All the above stated applications are already in use in the present time but we can do a lot more with this.
